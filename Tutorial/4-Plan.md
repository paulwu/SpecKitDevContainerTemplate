# Understanding the `/plan` Command in Spec-Kit

The `/plan` command transforms detailed requirements into a concrete technical architecture and implementation strategy. It's where business requirements meet technical reality, creating the blueprint that guides all subsequent development work.

## 🎯 What is `/plan`?

The `/plan` command creates **technical implementation plans** that include:
- **Technology stack** selection and justification
- **System architecture** and component design
- **Database schema** and data flow patterns
- **API design** and integration strategies
- **Deployment and infrastructure** requirements
- **Security implementation** approach

### Position in Spec-Kit Workflow

```
/constitution → /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
Foundation → Requirements → Decisions → Architecture → Tasks → Code
```

## 🚨 Why `/plan` is Essential

### The Problem Without Technical Planning

Projects that jump from requirements to coding suffer from:

- **Architecture drift** - Inconsistent technical decisions across components
- **Integration nightmares** - Components that don't work together
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Scale problems discovered too late
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Security considered as an afterthought
- **Technical debt accumulation** - Quick fixes instead of proper design
- **Team inefficiency** - Developers make conflicting architectural choices

### The Solution: Comprehensive Technical Planning

The `/plan` command **prevents these issues** by:

✅ **Establishing consistent architecture** across all components  
✅ **Identifying integration points** before implementation begins  
✅ **Planning for scale and performance** from the start  
✅ **Integrating security** into the core design  
✅ **Creating implementation roadmap** with clear dependencies

### High-Level Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[React Frontend] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    API --> Task[Task Service]
    API --> User[User Service]
    API --> Notify[Notification Service]
    
    Task --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    User --> DB
    Notify --> Queue[Redis Queue]
    Queue --> Email[Email Worker]
    Queue --> SMS[SMS Worker]
```

### Component Responsibilities
- **API Gateway**: Request routing, rate limiting, authentication validation
- **Authentication Service**: JWT token management, password hashing, MFA support  
- **Task Service**: CRUD operations, business logic, search and filtering
- **User Service**: Profile management, preferences, team membership
- **Notification Service**: Event publishing, template management, delivery scheduling

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - Client → API Gateway → Auth Service → JWT Token → Client Storage
   - Subsequent requests include JWT in Authorization header
   - Token refresh handled automatically with sliding expiration

2. **Task Management Flow**
   - Create/Update: Client → API Gateway → Task Service → Database → Event Bus
   - Real-time Updates: Event Bus → WebSocket Service → Connected Clients
   - Search: Client → API Gateway → Task Service → Elasticsearch → Response

3. **Notification Flow**
   - Trigger Event → Notification Service → Queue System → Worker Processes
   - Email/SMS delivery with retry logic and failure handling
   - Delivery status tracking with webhook confirmation
```

### **Database Schema and Data Architecture**

```markdown
## Database Design Plan

### PostgreSQL Schema Design
```sql
-- Users table with authentication and profile data
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Projects table for organizing tasks
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    owner_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tasks table with full feature support
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    assignee_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    creator_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'todo',
    priority VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'medium',
    due_date DATE,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexing Strategy
- **Performance Indexes**: user queries, project tasks, date ranges
- **Unique Constraints**: email addresses, project names per owner
- **Partial Indexes**: active records, incomplete tasks, recent activity
- **Composite Indexes**: multi-column queries, sorting optimization

### Data Partitioning Plan
- **Time-based partitioning**: Tasks by creation month for archival
- **User-based partitioning**: Large tenant data isolation
- **Read replicas**: Reporting queries separated from transactional load
- **Backup strategy**: Daily full backups with point-in-time recovery
```

### **API Design and Integration Architecture**

```markdown
## REST API Design Plan

### API Structure and Conventions
**Base URL**: `https://api.taskmanager.com/v1`  
**Authentication**: Bearer token (JWT) in Authorization header  
**Content Type**: JSON for all requests and responses  
**Error Format**: RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs

### Core API Endpoints

## Database Design for Chat

### Message Storage Strategy
```sql
-- Optimized for chat workload patterns
CREATE TABLE chat_rooms (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(50), -- 'direct', 'group', 'channel'
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Partitioned by date for efficient queries and archiving
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES chat_rooms(id),
    sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'text', -- 'text', 'image', 'file', 'system'
    media_url TEXT,
    reply_to_id UUID REFERENCES messages(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions for message archival
CREATE TABLE messages_2024_01 PARTITION OF messages
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Message Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for smooth infinite scroll
- **Index Strategy**: Compound indexes on (room_id, created_at) for message history
- **Archival Policy**: Messages older than 1 year moved to cold storage
- **Caching**: Recent messages cached in Redis with automatic expiration
```

## ⚠️ Common Anti-Patterns

### **Technology-First Instead of Requirement-First**
```
❌ "Let's use microservices because they're modern"
✅ "Given our team size and complexity requirements, a modular monolith with clear service boundaries provides better development velocity"

❌ "We should use NoSQL because it's scalable"
✅ "Based on our data relationships and query patterns, PostgreSQL with proper indexing meets our performance requirements while maintaining ACID properties"
```

### **Over-Engineering for Current Scale**
```
❌ "Build for 1 million users from day one"
✅ "Design architecture that can scale to 1 million users, but start with components that serve our current 1000 users efficiently"

❌ "Implement full microservices architecture for MVP"
✅ "Start with modular monolith, plan service boundaries for future extraction when scale demands it"
```

### **Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements**
```
❌ Planning only for functional features
✅ Include comprehensive planning for:
    - Performance (response times, throughput, resource usage)
    - Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
    - Reliability (uptime, error rates, recovery procedures)
    - Maintainability (code organization, testing, monitoring)
    - Scalability (horizontal scaling, database sharding, CDN)
```

### **Insufficient Integration Planning**
```
❌ "We'll figure out integrations during implementation"
✅ "All external system integrations planned with:
    - Authentication and API key management
    - Error handling and retry strategies
    - Rate limiting and quota management
    - Webhook handling and event processing
    - Testing strategies for third-party dependencies"
```

## 🚀 Advanced Planning Techniques

### **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

```markdown
# ADR-001: Database Technology Selection

## Status: Accepted

## Context
The task management system needs to store user data, projects, tasks, and relationships between these entities. We need to choose between SQL and NoSQL databases.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Rationale
- **Strong consistency**: Task assignments and project permissions require ACID properties
- **Complex queries**: Reporting features need JOIN operations and aggregation functions
- **JSON support**: PostgreSQL JSONB provides flexibility for custom task fields
- **Mature ecosystem**: Well-supported ORMs, migration tools, and monitoring solutions
- **Team expertise**: Team has strong PostgreSQL experience

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Strong data consistency, mature tooling, team productivity
- **Negative**: Vertical scaling limitations, more complex sharding if needed
- **Mitigation**: Plan for read replicas, consider partitioning for large datasets

## Alternatives Considered
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema but weaker consistency guarantees
- **DynamoDB**: Great for scale but limited query capabilities
- **MySQL**: Good option but PostgreSQL JSON support is superior
```

### **Layered Architecture Planning**

```typescript
// Domain-driven design with clean architecture
interface TaskManagementArchitecture {
  // Presentation Layer
  presentation: {
    webUI: ReactApplication;
    mobileUI: ReactNativeApplication;  
    publicAPI: RESTAPIEndpoints;
    webhooks: WebhookHandlers;
  };
  
  // Application Layer  
  application: {
    useCases: TaskUseCases;
    commandHandlers: CommandHandlers;
    eventHandlers: EventHandlers;
    queryHandlers: QueryHandlers;
  };
  
  // Domain Layer
  domain: {
    entities: [User, Project, Task];
    valueObjects: [TaskStatus, Priority];
    aggregates: ProjectAggregate;
    domainServices: TaskAssignmentService;
  };
  
  // Infrastructure Layer
  infrastructure: {
    database: PostgreSQLRepository;
    cache: RedisCache;
    messaging: EventBus;
    externalAPIs: IntegrationServices;
  };
}
```

2. **Peak Load**: 500 concurrent users, 60% read, 40% write operations  
3. **Stress Test**: 1000 concurrent users to identify breaking points
4. **Endurance Test**: 200 concurrent users for 4 hours to test memory leaks

### Performance Benchmarks
| Operation | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Task Creation | < 200ms | p95 response time |
| Task List Load | < 100ms | p95 response time |
| Real-time Update | < 50ms | WebSocket message delivery |
| Search Query | < 300ms | p95 response time |
| File Upload | < 2s for 10MB | Upload completion time |

### Monitoring and Alerting Plan
- **APM Integration**: New Relic for request tracing and performance monitoring
- **Custom Metrics**: Task completion rates, user engagement, feature adoption
- **Alert Thresholds**: Response time > 500ms, error rate > 1%, CPU > 80%
- **Dashboard Setup**: Real-time system health with business metrics correlation
