# Understanding the `/clarify` Command in Spec-Kit

The `/clarify` command is a critical step in Spec-Driven Development that transforms ambiguous requirements into concrete, actionable decisions. This guide explains why it's essential and how to use it effectively.

## üéØ What is `/clarify`?

The `/clarify` command is a **risk mitigation and decision-making** phase that sits between `/specify` (requirements definition) and `/plan` (technical architecture). It identifies underspecified areas in your requirements and forces explicit decisions before implementation begins.

### Position in Spec-Kit Workflow

```
/constitution ‚Üí /specify ‚Üí /clarify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks ‚Üí /implement
                  ‚Üë         ‚Üë         ‚Üë
               Requirements ‚Üí Decisions ‚Üí Architecture                
```

## üö® Why `/clarify` is Critical

### The Problem Without `/clarify`

When teams skip the clarification phase, they encounter:

- **Assumptions become bugs** - Developers make different assumptions about unclear requirements
- **Mid-development pivots** - Major architectural changes required when ambiguities surface
- **Scope creep** - Unclear requirements lead to feature expansion during implementation  
- **Team conflicts** - Different interpretations of the same specification
- **Technical debt** - Quick fixes for problems that should have been solved in design

### The Solution: Proactive Clarification

The `/clarify` command **prevents these issues** by:

‚úÖ **Identifying gaps** in specifications before coding begins  
‚úÖ **Forcing explicit decisions** on ambiguous requirements  
‚úÖ **Documenting rationale** for future reference and team alignment  
‚úÖ **Assessing technical risks** and implementation complexity  
‚úÖ **Establishing constraints** that guide the technical architecture  

---

## ü§î Why Multiple Choice Format?

The `/clarify` command presents **structured options** rather than open-ended questions. This design choice is intentional and serves several critical purposes:

### 1. **Prevents Analysis Paralysis** 

**Traditional approach:**
```
‚ùå "How should we handle user authentication?"
   (Leads to endless discussion and no decisions)
```

**Spec-Kit approach:**
```
‚úÖ USER AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY:

Option A: Simple email/password with basic session management
- Pros: Quick to implement, familiar UX, minimal dependencies
- Cons: Security concerns, no social login, password reset complexity
- Implementation: 2-3 days, requires email service integration

Option B: OAuth with multiple providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
- Pros: Better security, no password management, familiar to users
- Cons: External dependencies, more complex error handling
- Implementation: 4-5 days, requires OAuth provider configuration  

Option C: Enterprise SSO with SAML/OIDC support
- Pros: Enterprise-ready, centralized identity, compliance-friendly
- Cons: Complex setup, enterprise sales cycle, vendor dependencies
- Implementation: 1-2 weeks, requires identity provider integration

Which approach aligns with your user base and timeline?
```

### 2. **Exposes Trade-offs and Implications**

Each option explicitly shows:
- **Functional implications** - What the user experience will be
- **Technical implications** - What the development team must build
- **Business implications** - Timeline, cost, and strategic alignment
- **Risk implications** - What could go wrong and mitigation strategies

### 3. **Facilitates Stakeholder Alignment**

Multiple-choice format enables **cross-functional decision making**:

```
REAL-TIME COLLABORATION FEATURES:

Option A: Simple refresh-based updates (poll every 30 seconds)
üë§ Product: "Will users see changes immediately?"
üë®‚Äçüíª Engineering: "No, up to 30-second delay, but very reliable"
üíº Business: "Low cost, quick to market, acceptable for MVP"

Option B: WebSocket-based real-time sync
üë§ Product: "Perfect! Users see changes instantly"  
üë®‚Äçüíª Engineering: "More complex, need connection management and offline handling"
üíº Business: "Higher development cost, but better competitive position"

Option C: Hybrid approach with intelligent polling
üë§ Product: "Fast updates when active, efficient when idle"
üë®‚Äçüíª Engineering: "Moderate complexity, best of both worlds"
üíº Business: "Balanced cost/benefit, good technical compromise"
```

### 4. **Creates Decision Documentation**

When you choose an option, Spec-Kit automatically documents:
- **What** was decided and when
- **Why** this option was chosen over alternatives
- **What constraints** this creates for the technical plan
- **What risks** were accepted or mitigated

## üìã Common Clarification Categories

### **Data Architecture Decisions**

```
DATABASE PARTITIONING STRATEGY:

Option A: Partition by user ID
- Best for: Small to medium user bases
- Considerations: May hit hot partitions with power users
- Query patterns: Simple user-scoped queries

Option B: Partition by tenant + date  
- Best for: Multi-tenant applications with time-based data
- Considerations: Cross-partition queries for reporting
- Query patterns: Complex but scalable

Option C: Partition by feature domain
- Best for: Microservices architecture
- Considerations: Domain boundaries must be well-defined
- Query patterns: Domain-specific, requires service coordination
```

### **Integration Architecture Decisions**

```
EXTERNAL API INTEGRATION PATTERN:

Option A: Direct API calls from frontend
- Pros: Simple, fast for users, fewer server resources
- Cons: API keys exposed, CORS issues, no request aggregation
- Security: Client-side key management required

Option B: Backend proxy with caching
- Pros: Secure API keys, request optimization, caching benefits
- Cons: Additional latency, more server resources needed
- Security: Server-side key management, request filtering

Option C: Message queue with async processing
- Pros: Resilient to external service outages, scalable processing
- Cons: Complex architecture, eventual consistency, debugging difficulty
- Security: Centralized credential management, audit logging
```

### **User Experience Decisions**

```
OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY APPROACH:

Option A: Read-only offline mode
- UX: Users can view data but not edit when offline
- Technical: Simple local caching, no conflict resolution needed
- Data integrity: No sync conflicts possible

Option B: Full offline editing with conflict resolution
- UX: Seamless experience, users can work anywhere
- Technical: Complex sync logic, conflict resolution UI required
- Data integrity: Advanced merge strategies needed

Option C: Queue-based offline actions
- UX: Actions queued when offline, executed when online
- Technical: Action replay system, rollback capabilities
- Data integrity: Sequential processing ensures consistency
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use `/clarify` Effectively

### **Before Running `/clarify`**

1. **Review your specification** for obvious gaps or assumptions
2. **Consider non-functional requirements** (performance, security, scalability)
3. **Think about edge cases** and error scenarios
4. **Identify external dependencies** and integration points

### **When Evaluating Options**

#### Ask These Questions:
- **Timeline Impact**: How does each option affect delivery dates?
- **Team Skills**: Does our team have experience with this approach?
- **Future Flexibility**: How easy will it be to change this decision later?
- **Risk Tolerance**: What's the worst-case scenario for each option?
- **User Impact**: How does this affect the user experience?

#### Involve the Right People:
- **Product decisions** ‚Üí Product manager, UX designer
- **Technical decisions** ‚Üí Lead developer, architect
- **Security decisions** ‚Üí Security team, compliance officer
- **Infrastructure decisions** ‚Üí DevOps, platform team

### **After Making Decisions**

1. **Document rationale** - Why was this option chosen?
2. **Note constraints** - What limitations does this create?
3. **Identify risks** - What could go wrong with this choice?
4. **Plan validation** - How will you test these assumptions?

## üìä Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform

Let's walk through a `/clarify` session for an e-commerce platform:

### Initial Specification
*"Build an e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing."*

### Clarification Questions Generated

```
PRODUCT CATALOG SCALE:

Option A: Single-region catalog (< 10K products)
- Architecture: Relational database, server-side rendering
- Performance: Fast for small catalogs, simple caching
- Scaling: Vertical scaling, regional limitations

Option B: Multi-region catalog (10K-100K products)  
- Architecture: Distributed database, CDN integration
- Performance: Geographic optimization, complex caching
- Scaling: Horizontal scaling, global reach

Option C: Marketplace model (100K+ products, multiple vendors)
- Architecture: Microservices, search engine integration  
- Performance: Advanced search, recommendation engines
- Scaling: Service mesh, vendor isolation required

Decision: Option B - Multi-region catalog
Rationale: Planning for international expansion within 12 months
Constraints: Must support multiple currencies and languages
```

```
PAYMENT PROCESSING APPROACH:

Option A: Single payment provider (Stripe)
- Integration: Simple, well-documented APIs
- Features: Basic credit card processing, subscriptions
- Risk: Vendor lock-in, limited regional support

Option B: Payment orchestration (multiple providers)
- Integration: Complex routing logic, failover systems
- Features: Regional optimization, payment method diversity
- Risk: Integration complexity, testing overhead

Option C: Custom payment processing
- Integration: Full control, direct bank relationships
- Features: Minimal fees, complete customization
- Risk: Regulatory compliance, security responsibilities

Decision: Option A for MVP, Option B for international expansion
Rationale: Minimize initial complexity while planning for growth
Constraints: Must design payment abstraction layer from start
```

### Impact on Technical Plan

These decisions directly constrain the `/plan` phase:
- Database architecture must support multi-region deployment
- Payment system must use abstraction patterns for future flexibility
- Internationalization must be built into the core architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Anti-Patterns

### **Skipping `/clarify` Entirely**
```
‚ùå "Our specification is clear enough"
‚úÖ "Let's run /clarify to see what we might have missed"
```

### **Choosing Based on Familiarity Alone**
```
‚ùå "We always use MySQL, so let's use MySQL"
‚úÖ "Given our scale and query patterns, what database makes sense?"
```

### **Avoiding Difficult Decisions**
```
‚ùå "We'll figure out authentication later"
‚úÖ "Authentication affects our entire architecture - let's decide now"
```

### **Not Documenting Rationale**
```
‚ùå "We chose Option B"
‚úÖ "We chose Option B because it balances complexity with scalability while fitting our 6-month timeline"
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

You'll know `/clarify` is working when you see:

### **Quantitative Indicators**
- **Fewer mid-development architecture changes**
- **Reduced time spent in "clarification meetings"**
- **Faster code reviews** (less back-and-forth on approach)
- **Lower defect rates** due to misunderstood requirements

### **Qualitative Indicators**
- **Team alignment** on technical approaches before coding
- **Confident decision-making** during implementation
- **Clear escalation paths** when assumptions prove incorrect
- **Better stakeholder communication** about trade-offs

---

## üöÄ Advanced `/clarify` Techniques

### **Iterative Clarification**

Don't try to clarify everything at once:

```bash
# Round 1: Core architecture decisions
/clarify Focus on data architecture, authentication, and deployment model

# Implement core foundation
/plan /tasks /implement

# Round 2: Feature-specific decisions  
/clarify Address user management, payment flows, and reporting requirements

# Continue iterative development
/plan /tasks /implement
```

### **Risk-Weighted Decision Making**

Weight your decisions by risk and impact:

```
HIGH RISK + HIGH IMPACT = Detailed analysis required
HIGH RISK + LOW IMPACT = Choose conservative option
LOW RISK + HIGH IMPACT = Prototype and validate quickly
LOW RISK + LOW IMPACT = Make fast decision and move on
```

### **Stakeholder-Specific Clarification**

Tailor clarification sessions to your audience:

```bash
# For technical decisions
/clarify Focus on architecture, performance, and maintainability concerns

# For product decisions  
/clarify Focus on user experience, feature priority, and market positioning

# For business decisions
/clarify Focus on cost, timeline, and strategic alignment
```

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **`/clarify` prevents expensive mistakes** by forcing decisions before implementation
2. **Multiple-choice format** eliminates analysis paralysis and creates actionable decisions
3. **Cross-functional alignment** happens naturally when trade-offs are made explicit
4. **Documentation is automatic** when decisions are made through structured options
5. **Iterative clarification** works better than trying to solve everything at once

**Remember**: The goal isn't to make perfect decisions, but to make **conscious, documented decisions** that the entire team understands and agrees upon. `/clarify` transforms assumptions into agreements and ambiguity into architecture.
