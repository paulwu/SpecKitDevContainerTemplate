# Understanding the `/specify` Command in Spec-Kit

The `/specify` command transforms high-level ideas into detailed, actionable requirements that AI agents can understand and implement. It's the bridge between business vision and technical execution, creating the blueprint for everything that follows in the development process.

## 🎯 What is `/specify`?

The `/specify` command creates **detailed feature specifications** that include:
- **User stories** and acceptance criteria
- **Functional requirements** with clear boundaries
- **User experience** flows and interactions
- **Data requirements** and business rules
- **Integration points** and external dependencies

### Position in Spec-Kit Workflow

```
/constitution → /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
Foundation → Requirements → Decisions → Architecture → Tasks → Code
```

## 🚨 Why `/specify` is Critical

### The Problem Without Clear Specifications

Projects with vague requirements suffer from:

- **Feature creep** - Unclear boundaries lead to expanding scope
- **Implementation inconsistencies** - Different developers interpret requirements differently
- **User experience gaps** - Missing use cases and edge cases
- **Integration failures** - Unclear external system requirements
- **Testing challenges** - No clear acceptance criteria for validation
- **Stakeholder misalignment** - Different expectations across team members

### The Solution: Comprehensive Specification

The `/specify` command **prevents these issues** by:

✅ **Defining clear boundaries** for what will and won't be built  
✅ **Creating testable criteria** for feature completion  
✅ **Establishing user experience** requirements upfront  
✅ **Documenting business rules** and data requirements  
✅ **Identifying integration points** before architecture decisions

## ⚠️ Common Anti-Patterns

### **Vague or Unmeasurable Requirements**
```
❌ "Build a user-friendly interface"
✅ "Create an interface where users can complete primary tasks within 3 clicks, with user testing validation showing 90% task completion rate"

❌ "Add search functionality"  
✅ "Implement search with auto-complete, fuzzy matching, and results returned within 200ms, supporting filters by category, date range, and user-defined tags"

❌ "Make it secure"
✅ "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with MFA support, rate limiting (100 req/min), input sanitization, and audit logging for all user actions"
```

### **Technology-First Instead of Outcome-First**
```
❌ "Use React hooks for state management"
✅ "Provide responsive UI that updates in real-time as users interact with data, maintaining state across browser sessions"

❌ "Implement GraphQL API"
✅ "Provide flexible data querying that allows frontend to request exactly the data needed, reducing over-fetching and improving performance"
```

### **Missing Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**
```
❌ Specifying only the happy path
✅ Including comprehensive error handling:
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Invalid user input scenarios
    - Permission and authorization edge cases  
    - Data corruption or inconsistency scenarios
    - Third-party service failures
```

### **Stakeholder Assumption Instead of User Research**
```
❌ "Users want a dashboard with all possible metrics"
✅ "Based on user interviews, users prioritize seeing their top 3 KPIs immediately, with ability to drill down into details on demand"

❌ "The checkout process should have all payment options"
✅ "Support the payment methods used by 95% of our target market (credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay) based on regional payment preference data"
```

## 🚀 Advanced Specification Techniques

### **Behavior-Driven Specification**

```markdown
## Specification: User Authentication

### Scenario: Successful Login
**Given** a registered user with email "user@example.com" and password "SecurePass123!"  
**When** they enter correct credentials on the login form  
**Then** they should be redirected to their dashboard  
**And** their session should be valid for 30 minutes  
**And** their last login timestamp should be updated

### Scenario: Failed Login Attempt  
**Given** a registered user with email "user@example.com"  
**When** they enter an incorrect password  
**Then** they should see "Invalid credentials" error message  
**And** the failed attempt should be logged for security monitoring  
**And** after 5 failed attempts, account should be temporarily locked for 15 minutes

### Scenario: Password Reset Flow
**Given** a user who has forgotten their password  
**When** they click "Forgot Password" and enter their email  
**Then** they should receive a reset link within 5 minutes  
**And** the reset link should expire after 1 hour  
**And** using the reset link should allow them to set a new password
```

### **Data-Driven Specification**

```markdown
## E-commerce Product Search Specification

### Search Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: 95% of searches return results within 200ms
- **Relevance**: Top 3 results match user intent for 85% of queries (based on click-through rate)
- **Completeness**: Search covers 100% of catalog with real-time inventory status

### Search Functionality Matrix
| Query Type | Expected Behavior | Examples |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Product Name | Exact and fuzzy matching | "iPhone 14" → iPhone 14 variations |
| Category | Category-scoped results | "laptops" → All laptop products |
| Brand + Category | Combined filtering | "Nike shoes" → Nike footwear only |
| Feature-based | Attribute matching | "waterproof bluetooth speaker" |
| Price Range | Numerical filtering | "under $100" → Products ≤ $100 |

### Search Result Enhancement
- **Auto-complete**: Suggest completions after 2 characters typed
- **Spell Correction**: Handle misspellings with "Did you mean?" suggestions  
- **Filters**: Dynamic facets based on search results (brand, price, rating, availability)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Start with user outcomes** - Focus on what users need to accomplish, not technical features
2. **Be specific and measurable** - Vague requirements lead to implementation guesswork
3. **Include the full user journey** - Don't just specify features, specify the complete experience
4. **Document edge cases and errors** - The unhappy path is just as important as the happy path
5. **Validate assumptions with data** - Base requirements on user research, not stakeholder opinions

**Remember**: A great specification is like a **contract between business vision and technical implementation**. When done well, it eliminates ambiguity, reduces rework, and ensures that what gets built actually solves the intended problem.
